# Nothing of any significance, just rust experiments

## A minimalistic Rust project made to test your DP input speed. 
## DP is dragon punch, 623 motion input. 

## The project utilizes separate thread for rendering, channels for communication, and a simple event loop to handle input. 
## Ratatui is used for rendering the grid and input history.
